    "1904": "The video shows a green truck with the word \"API\" on its side, driving on a wet road. The camera is inside another vehicle, following the truck closely. As the video progresses, the truck swerves and eventually tips over onto its side. The camera captures the moment of the accident from various angles, including close-ups of the truck's wheels and undercarriage. The sky is overcast, and the road appears slick from rain.",
    "1920": "A semi-truck is driving down a highway in the rain. It swerves to avoid a car and then crashes into a guardrail."
