    "128": "The video begins with a wide shot of a desert landscape featuring a solitary building in the center. The building is rectangular, with a flat roof and multiple windows. It appears to be made of concrete or a similar material. The surrounding area is barren, with sparse vegetation and hills in the background. As the video progresses, an explosion occurs at the base of the building, causing a large plume of smoke and dust to rise into the air. The smoke is dark gray and billows upwards, eventually obscuring the building from view. The dust cloud expands outwards, engulfing the area around the building.",
